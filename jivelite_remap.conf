# Key remapping configuration file
# Format: SOURCE_KEY:DEST_KEY:KEY_HELD
#
# KEY_HELD values:
#   0 = Pass-through mode: send press/release as they occur
#   1 = Send momentary press+release on key release if held < 0.5s
#   2 = Send momentary press+release on key release if held >= 0.5s
#
# Note: If KEY_HELD=0 is defined for a key, you cannot also define 1 or 2 for that key.
#       But you can have both 1 and 2 defined for the same key (like triggers).
#
# Examples:
# KEY_A:KEY_B:0        # Pass-through: A key sends B press/release in real-time
# KEY_C:KEY_D:1        # Short press: C held <0.5s sends momentary D press+release on release
# KEY_E:KEY_F:2        # Long press: E held >=0.5s sends momentary F press+release on release
